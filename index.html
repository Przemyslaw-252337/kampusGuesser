    This file acts as the landing page for the Kampus Guesser project.

    When the project is served from the root of the repository (for example
    using VS Code’s live server), the browser will look for an index.html
    file at the root. Previously no such file existed and the browser
    displayed a directory listing instead of loading the actual game.

    To solve this we create a minimal index that immediately redirects
    the user to the game contained in the “gra” folder.  The redirection
    happens on page load and does not rely on JavaScript so it works in
    most browsers.
